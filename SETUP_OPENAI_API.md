## Setting Up Your OpenAI API Key

### Step 1: Get Your API Key
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Sign in or create account
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-...`)

### Step 2: Add API Key to System

#### Option A: Environment Variable (Recommended)
```bash
# Windows (Command Prompt)
setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your-api-key-here"

# Windows (PowerShell)  
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"

# Then restart your terminal
```

#### Option B: Create .env File
Create file: `C:\Users\tanar\Glyph\Career Command Center\applying-assistant\.env`
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### Step 3: Test Your Setup

Run this command to test:
```bash
cd "C:\Users\tanar\Glyph\Career Command Center\applying-assistant\src"
python ai_powered_application_engine.py
```

You should see:
```
ü§ñ AI-Powered Application Engine initialized

## What You'll Get with API Key

### Before (Templates):
```
Dear OpenAI Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Infrastructure Engineer position...
[Generic template content]
```

### After (AI-Generated):
```
Dear OpenAI Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Senior Infrastructure Engineer - AI Platform position at OpenAI. Having researched your recent breakthroughs in GPT-4 model scaling and infrastructure challenges around massive GPU cluster management, I'm excited about the opportunity to bring my 99.8% uptime track record to your AI model serving infrastructure...

[Continues with specific company insights, technical understanding, and strategic positioning]
```

### Research Depth Example:

**Template Mode (Instant)**:
- Company: "OpenAI is an AI research company"
- Tech Stack: "Python, Kubernetes"

**AI Research Mode (60+ seconds)**:
- Business Model: "OpenAI operates on a freemium API model with enterprise partnerships, recently achieving $1B+ revenue run rate through ChatGPT Plus subscriptions and API services to 2M+ developers"
- Technical Challenges: "Scaling inference infrastructure for 100M+ weekly ChatGPT users while managing training workloads on 25,000+ GPU clusters"  
- Strategic Positioning: "Your infrastructure reliability experience directly addresses OpenAI's core challenge of maintaining 99.9% uptime for real-time AI model serving at unprecedented scale"

## Cost Information

- **Typical cost per application**: $0.50 - $2.00
- **What you get**: 60-120 seconds of deep AI analysis
- **Value**: Transforms mediocre applications into strategic, personalized packages

## Troubleshooting

### "No API Key Found"
- Make sure you set the environment variable or .env file
- Restart your terminal after setting environment variable
- Check the key starts with `sk-`

### "API Key Invalid"  
- Verify the key is copied correctly (no extra spaces)
- Check your OpenAI account has credits
- Make sure the key hasn't expired

### "Takes Too Long"
- This is normal! Deep research takes 60-120 seconds
- The system shows progress: "Phase 1: Deep research (30-60 seconds)"
- Quality takes time - this is what makes it better than templates

## Quick Test Command

```bash
# Test if your API key is working
cd "C:\Users\tanar\Glyph\Career Command Center\applying-assistant\src"
python -c "
import os
import openai
api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
if api_key:
    client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=api_key)
    print('‚úÖ API Key found and client initialized')
    print(f'üîë Key starts with: {api_key[:10]}...')
else:
    print('‚ùå No API key found')
"
```
