# âš¡ SIMPLE FIX - GUI Still in Template Mode

## The Issue
Your .env file currently has the API key commented out:
```
# Add your OpenAI API key here
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

## The Fix (2 steps)

### Step 1: Open the .env file
File location: `C:\Users\tanar\Glyph\Career Command Center\applying-assistant\.env`

### Step 2: Edit line 2
**Change:**
```
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

**To:**
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key-here
```

**Important:**
- Remove the `#` at the beginning
- Replace `sk-your-key-here` with your real OpenAI API key
- Your API key should start with `sk-proj-` or similar

## After the Fix
1. Save the .env file
2. Restart the GUI
3. You should see: "AI-POWERED MODE" instead of "TEMPLATE MODE"

## Get Your API Key
If you don't have an OpenAI API key yet:
1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Create a new secret key
3. Copy it and use it in the .env file

## Test the Fix
After editing, you can test by running:
```bash
cd "C:\Users\tanar\Glyph\Career Command Center\applying-assistant"
python simple_debug.py
```

Look for: `ai_mode value: True` (instead of False)

The fix is just **uncommenting the API key line** and adding your actual key!
