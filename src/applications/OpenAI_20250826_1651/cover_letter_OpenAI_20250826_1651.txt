COVER LETTER - OpenAI - Senior Infrastructure Engineer
============================================================

Dear OpenAI Team,

I was excited to read about Research in progress. Your innovation in this space aligns perfectly with my transition from Infrastructure Engineering to AI/automation, and I'd love to contribute to the Senior Infrastructure Engineer role at OpenAI.

As an Infrastructure Engineer with 4+ years maintaining 99.8% uptime for enterprise systems, I bring a unique perspective to AI development: the reliability-first mindset essential for production AI systems.

My recent accomplishments demonstrate this infrastructure to AI transition:
• Built production-ready GitHub Development Logger Bot using Python and API integration
• Reduced operational workload by 40% through custom automation scripts  
• Developed systematic approaches to complex problem-solving that translate directly to AI challenges

What excites me about OpenAI is your commitment to Innovation. My infrastructure foundation provides the stability mindset your AI systems need, while my proven ability to learn and implement new technologies positions me to grow quickly in this role.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my infrastructure reliability experience and emerging AI automation skills can contribute to OpenAI's continued success.

Best regards,
Treyten Ellingson
